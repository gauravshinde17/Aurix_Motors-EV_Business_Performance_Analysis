## Key Insights

### Revenue & Profitability
- Consistent multi-year revenue growth with stable gross margins (~20%)
- Net profitability improves gradually due to **operating leverage**
- Manufacturing and battery costs dominate total cost structure, reflecting real EV economics

---

### Sales & Product Mix
- **Aurix X1** drives volume with thinner margins  
- **Aurix Prime and Z** protect pricing power and margin stability  
- Discounting remains controlled, indicating **demand-led growth**

---

### Regional Strategy
- **Asia:** Volume-driven growth and manufacturing scale  
- **Europe:** Stable, efficiency-focused performance  
- **North America:** Lower volume but higher revenue per unit  

This asymmetric strategy reduces regional dependency risk.

---

### Operations & Manufacturing
- Asia plant serves as the production backbone  
- Europe achieves lowest downtime and highest efficiency  
- North America handles complex and premium builds with higher downtime  
- Clear trade-offs between scale, efficiency, and flexibility

---

### Workforce Insights
- Workforce aligns with production needs, not revenue inflation  
- **North America shows highest revenue per employee** despite higher labor cost  
- Manufacturing dominates headcount; administrative overhead remains lean  
- Productivity varies by region, not workforce size

---

### Customer Experience
- Strong overall customer satisfaction (avg rating > 4.0)
- Negative feedback driven mainly by EV industry challenges:
  - Battery performance
  - Software maturity
  - Service scalability
- Mass-market models generate higher feedback volume
- Premium models lead satisfaction and recommendation rates

---

## Key Takeaways
- Sustainable EV growth depends on **balanced trade-offs**, not single KPIs  
- Scale, margin, and efficiency must coexist  
- Regional and model-level differentiation is critical  
- Customer sentiment aligns closely with pricing and operational execution  
- Integrated dashboards significantly improve executive decision-making
